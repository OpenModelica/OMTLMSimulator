\chapter{Co-Simulation Framework}
A general framework for meta-model based co-simulations has previously
been designed~\cite{Siemers+Nakhimovski+Fritzson-05}. The design goals
for the simulation part of the framework were portability, simplicity
to incorporate new simulation tools, and computational efficiency.
These goals were realized by defining the following concepts and
interfaces:

\textbf{External interface.} A named point on a mechanical object
where position and velocity can be evaluated and reaction load (force
and moment) applied. To guarantee numerical stability when utilising
different numerical solvers in the co-simulation, only interfaces based
on the {\em transmission line modelling} method, see Section~\ref{secTLMtheory}, are
currently supported.

%\item
\textbf{Simulation manager.} The central simulation engine. It is a stand alone
program that reads an XML definition of the coupled simulation.  It
then starts \emph{external model simulations} and provides the
communication bridge between the running simulations. The external
models only communicate with the simulation manager which acts as a
broker marshalling information between the external models. Simulation
manager sees every external model as a black box having one or several
external interfaces. The information is then forwarded between
external interfaces belonging to different external
models. Additionally the simulation manager opens a network port for
monitoring all communicated data.

%\item
\textbf{Interface plug-in.} A small C++ library having a single
abstract class representing external interface for a specific
simulation tool. The interface plug-in can be seen by an external
model simulator as an external load that depends on position, velocity
and time. The implementation of the plug-in handles the necessary
communications with the simulation manager. It also handles necessary
coordinate system transformations into the global meta-model inertial
system. All positions and velocities are transformed from the
external-model (simulation-tool specific) inertial system to the
global meta-model inertial system. All reaction loads are translated
back into the local inertial system. This constant transformation is
stored in the meta-model and sent to the corresponding interface
plug-in on simulation start up.
%\item

\textbf{External model simulator.} Any simulation program that has incorporated
the interface plug-in as a part of its model. A small script that
takes the general parameters as input and starts the specific
simulation tool is an additional requirement. This intermediate step
is necessary since the simulation manager needs a common way
to start all the components and each tool might have some specific
start procedures.
%\end{itemize}

\section{Requirements on External Model Simulators}
\label{sec:requirements}
External models are associated with specialised simulation tools. Even
though many simulation tools have interfaces to external functions, the
interfaces differ between tools. Therefore it is first necessary that
a software developer who is familiar with the particular tool
architecture, designs and implements the {\em external interface} for
each tool. That is, to create a tool specific wrapper for the {\em
interface plug-in} of the simulation framework.

The following functionality is required from all simulation
tools that implement the interface plug-in and want to participate in
co-simulation:
\begin{itemize}
\item Possibility to start simulation externally or in batch mode.
  The developer of the tool specific interface must provide a start up
  program. This is used by the simulation manager to set-up global
  simulation parameters, that is, start time, end time, and max time
  step for each co-simulation participant. Regarding the maximum time
  step length: The current co-simulation communication protocol is
  based on the {\em transmission line modelling} method, see
  Section~\ref{secTLMtheory} for details. This method requires a
  certain communication time control, i.e., time steps need to be
  within a physically motivated limit.

\item Possibility to integrate the {\em interface plug-in} into the tool specific
	adaptor. Note that the tool independent part of the plug-in is
	implemented in C++. Some tools require external functions to
	be implemented in, e.g., C or Fortran. In such cases the C++
	code can be invoked from a C or Fortran function.

\item Ability to deliver position, orientation and velocity of a
	point to the {\em interface plug-in} and receive the reaction
	load (force and moment) to be applied at this point.

\item Ability to send information about the taken solver steps to the
  interface. This is important for variable time step solvers. Data is
  send from one co-simulation party to the other when a time step is
  completed, that is, if the solver, after many iterations, decided
  what step it will take next. This information needs to be send to
  the TLMPlugin.

\item Correct handling of shutdown signals coming from the tool specific
	wrapper. In some cases the {\em simulation manager} needs to
	take down the simulation tool in a controlled way. This can be
	achieved by a tool specific API ({\em Application Programming
	Interface}) call or simply handling of exit signals.

\end{itemize}

Additionally it is desirable that the simulation tool can export
surface geometry (graphics) for visualisation in the meta-model
environment. Surface geometry is not required for correct
meta-modelling but beneficial for visual model verification.

%These requirements are met by all the simulation tools investigated in
%this work, see Table~\ref{tab:SimTools}

Most of the commonly used simulation tools offer some kind of external
connection either through inter process communication (IPC), e.g.,
network sockets or remote procedure calls, or an application
programming interface (API). Both options are acceptable for
implementation of the interface plug-in as long as they fulfil the
requirements above. The main focus of this work is on transient
simulations of mechanical systems. Simulation tools that are of
interest for this work are pure mechanical system and multi physics
tools. All of the tools that have been considered for integration into
the co-simulation framework comply with the requirements, some of the
tools are shown in Table~\ref{tab:SimTools}. Interface plug-ins for
SKF's BEAST, SKF's Orpheus, MSC.ADAMS, Matlab/Simulink, and Modelica
have successfully been implemented and tested.

\section{External Model startup}
The requirements on the external model simulators, that is, the
simulation tools that are supposed to participate in a meta-model
simulation are defined above, see Section~\ref{sec:requirements}. One
requirement specifies that the simulation tool should be executable in
batch mode, this is, the simulation manager should be able to start
the simulation tool and pass certain parameters to the program.

The developer of the simulation tool specific adapter (TLMPlugin)
should provide a start-up program/script that accepts the following
command line parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Model} - the name of the sub-model as presented in the
meta-model definition. This name typically corresponds to the
component specific input file name.
\item {FromTime} - start time for the simulation.
\item {ToTime} - end time for the simulation.
\item {Step} - maximum time step allowed for the simulation. This depends on
the minimum TLM delay associated with one of the TLM links connected to the sub-model.
\item {Server:port} - name of the host machine running TLM manager application and
the TCP/IP port where TLM server is listening. This information is required for
TLM-plugin initialization. It is provided by the TLM manager as the last
argument to the start script.
\end{itemize}

A sample OpenModelica Linux start-up script could look like this:
{\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
#!/bin/sh
# OpenModelica TLM start-up script
# Start with 6 arguments:
# 1 XModelName (XModel directory)
# 2 start-time
# 3 end-time

echo // Autogenerated modelica script for TLM cosimulation > $MOSFILE
echo "setEnvironmentVar( \"MODELICAUSERCFLAGS\", \\
                         \"-I${TLMModelicaPath} \\
                         -L${TLMModelicaPath}/${ABI}\");" >> $MOSFILE
echo "loadModel(Modelica);" >> $MOSFILE
echo "loadFile(\"${TLMModelicaPath}/TLM.mo\");" >> $MOSFILE
echo "loadFile(\"$6\");" >> $MOSFILE
echo "getErrorString();" >> $MOSFILE
echo "checkModel($MODELNAME);" >> $MOSFILE
echo "getErrorString();" >> $MOSFILE
echo "translateModel($MODELNAME);" >> $MOSFILE
echo "getErrorString();" >> $MOSFILE
echo "simulate($MODELNAME, startTime=$2, \\
                           stopTime=$3, \\
                           numberOfIntervals=$INTERVALS, \\
                           method=\"dassl\", \\
                           outputFormat=\"plt\");" >> $MOSFILE
echo "getErrorString();" >> $MOSFILE

echo Starting OpenModelica with: $OMC_Cmd $MOSFILE

\end{verbatim}
}

A sample OpenModelica Windows batch start-up script could look like this:
{\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
echo off
REM OpenModelica TLM start-up script
REM Start with 6 arguments:
REM 1 XModelName (XModel directory)
REM 2 start-time
REM 3 end-time
REM 4 max-time-step
REM 5 server-name:port
REM 6 model-file

set OpenModelicaPath=C:/OpenModelica1.8.1
set OMC_Cmd=%OpenModelicaPath%/bin/omc.exe
set TLMCONFIGFILE=tlm.config

cd %1

echo Writing caseID %1 and server name %5 to file %TLMCONFIGFILE%
echo %1 > %TLMCONFIGFILE%
echo %5 >> %TLMCONFIGFILE%
echo %2 >> %TLMCONFIGFILE%
echo %3 >> %TLMCONFIGFILE%
echo %4 >> %TLMCONFIGFILE%

set MOSFILE=%1.mos
for /F %%I in ("%6") do set MODELNAME=%%~nI
for /F %%I in ("%Mofile%") do set MODELNAME_WITH_MO=%%I
calc (%3-%2)/%4
call result.bat
set INTERVALS=%res%

echo Writing %MOSFILE%
echo // Autogenerated modelica script for TLM cosimulation > %MOSFILE%
echo setEnvironmentVar("MODELICAUSERLFLAGS", \\
                       "-L/c/OpenModelica/sources/TLMPlugin/Modelica/WINDOWS32"); >> %MOSFILE%
echo loadModel(Modelica); >> %MOSFILE%
echo loadFile("%6"); >> %MOSFILE%
echo checkModel(%MODELNAME%); >> %MOSFILE%
echo simulate(%MODELNAME%, startTime=%2, stopTime=%3, \\
              numberOfIntervals=%INTERVALS%, \\
              tolerance=0.000001, \\
              method="euler", \\
              outputFormat="plt", \\
              variableFilter="x"); >> %MOSFILE%

echo Starting OpenModelica with: %OMC_Cmd% %MOSFILE%
%OMC_Cmd% %1.mos > %1.simlog
\end{verbatim}
}

NOTE, that the above approach requires that the Modelica TLMPlugin
reads the file ``\$TLMCONFIGFILE'' in order to get the TLM parameters.

\section{Meta-Model Simulation}
A meta-model simulation environment has been created that is based on
the previously defined co-simulation framework. The system design of
the environment is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:SystemDesign}. The
environment provides:
\begin{itemize}
\item Generality, due to the general framework
	that allows for integration of many different simulation
	tools.
\item A generic method of co-simulation based on a meta-model.
\item A general method of external model execution, i.e., all
	simulation tools involved are executed. Generality is achieved
	by a platform independent start up command that takes care of
	possible actions, i.e., remote login, file transfer, or set up
	of a parallel simulation environment.
\item Communication and data transfer between the different external
	models.
\item Data monitoring for analysis and post processing.
\item Controlled simulation termination where all external models are
	taken down in a correct way. This includes error handling due
	to external model failure or network problems.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[ht]\begin{center}
    %\epsfig{file=MetaModelSysDesign2.eps, width=10cm}
   {\includegraphics[width=9cm]{figs/MetaModelSysDesign2.pdf}}
    \caption{The system design for the meta-model simulation
    environment. } \label{fig:SystemDesign}
\end{center}\end{figure}

In addition to the {\em simulation manager} a meta-model {\em
  simulator} is included in the design that can start and monitor the
meta-model simulation.
%It creates its own internal meta-model
%structure for best simulation control and storage of meta-model
%simulation results.
The simulation manager has been designed to act as a network server
that allows several clients to connect and monitor the data flow
between the interconnected external model simulators. The {\em
  simulator} can connect to this port. All data received by the
simulation manager from the external model simulators is passed on to
the simulator that stores results in the meta-model output file.  This
client server architecture has some advantages over an integrated
solution where the simulation manager is part of the simulator:
\begin{itemize}
%\item Improved performance of the simulation manager because all file
%	I/O is handled by the simulator.
\item The simulator and simulation manager can run on different machines,
	this is useful, for instance, if the simulation start up must
	be performed on a machine other than the user's local machine.
\item Other processes can connect to the simulation manager's
	monitoring port. This allows, for instance, to visually
	monitor the co-simulation.
\end{itemize}

The simulation-manager manages start up of the different
simulation tools (external model simulators) and communication between
these tools, as defined by the simulation framework, see
Figure~\ref{fig:MMSystem}. Each simulation tool implements the
interface plug-in that handles the necessary communication with the
simulation manager. The manager keeps an internal interconnection
table for all connected external interfaces and forwards all received
packages accordingly.

\begin{figure}[ht]\begin{center}
%    \input{TLM_system.tex}
   {\includegraphics[width=9cm]{figs/TLM_system.pdf}}
    \caption{The simulation manager handles start up and communication
	between the tool specific simulators.}
    \label{fig:MMSystem}
\end{center}\end{figure}

Simulation results can be analysed in the post-processing
applications, i.e., a two dimensional plotting program and a three
dimensional visualisation tool, i.e., the meta-model editor
(MME). Data animation of system dynamics is possible to a limited
extent based on the data that is exchanged in the external interfaces.

\section{Meta-Model XML Files}
\label{meta}
The TLM default implementation contains a XML meta-model reader, that
can be used by the simulation manager to read the meta-model from an
XML file.

A Meta-Model contains the following XML nodes:
\begin{description}
\item[Model] is the top Meta-Model node that contains a list of {\tt SubModels} and {\tt Connections}.
\item[SubModels] is the node that contains the list of all {\tt SubModel} nodes.
\item[SubModel] is used for the external models. There is a {\tt
  SubModel} node for each external model that participates in the
  co-simulation. It defines a sub-model name used in the meta-model
  and the start method and the simulation tool specific model files
  that needed to run the simulation. Each {\tt SubModel} node also
  contains a list of {\tt InterfacePoint} nodes.
\item[InterfacePoint] nodes are used to specify the TLM interfaces of
  each external model, that is, each {\tt SubModel}. It defines the
  name of a certain interface in the external model.
\item[Connections] is the node that contains the list of all {\tt Connection} nodes.
\item[Connection] nodes define connections between two connected {\tt
  InterfacePoint}s, that is, a connection between two TLM
  interfaces. TLM parameters are specified for each connection.
\item[SimulationParams] node defines global meta-model simulation
  parameters. Total simulation start time, end time, and network port
  are defined in this node.
\end{description}
