This is a adjusted version of the general TLMPlugin/Modelica
implementation that is adapted to work specifically with the
OpenModelica dassl solver. It makes use of the RHSFinalFlag that is
defined in dassl.c for improved co-simulation performance and
accuracy.

It requires thus the dassl solver. If you need to run another solver
you should run the general Modelica TLM plugin instead. 


Supplied in this version are:
-----------------------------
OM_TLM.mo - An adjusted version of TLMPlugin/Modelica/TLM.mo that skips the "when" statement and tlm_setmotion(...) 

libtlmopenmodelica.a (or .lib) - the library used by external functions in OM_TLM.mo, based on:
 - tlmforce.h
 - tlmforce.c 

StartTLMOpenModelica(.bat) - Sample startup script for OpenModelica co-simulation components (external models)


How to install:
---------------
A Unix style makefile is supplied, simply type:
> make install

You also need to compile the tlmmanager. To do this "cd" into TLMPlugin main directory and type:
> make install 


How to run:
-----------
You probably need to adjust the path settings in bin/StartTLMOpenModelica(.bat) to reflect your system settings.

Then you should be able to run:
> tlmmanager 


Test example:
-------------
The simple pendulum MetaModel pendulum.xml in TLMPlugin/MetaModels/OmcOmcPendulum has been adjusted to 
work with the OpenModelica TLM plugin. Go to this directory and run the co-simulation this way:
> tlmmanager pendulum.xml
