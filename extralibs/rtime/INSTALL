Instructions for configuring, building, and installing librtime.a +
include-files and man-pages.

I have used GNU's autoconf to build this software for various
architectures.

To build and install this software:


1. Configure the software

	./configure --prefix=<install_dir> <cpu-vendor-os>

The <install_dir> is the directory where this software is going to be
installed. The paths in the man-pages is modified accordingly!  The
default prefix is /usr/local.
   
<cpu-vendor-os> is a description of the host for which you are going to
build this software.

Current possible alternatives:

    powerpc-parsytec-parix
    parix
	Configure this software for PARIX-1.3

    sparc-sun-sol2
    sparc
    sun
    solaris
	Configure this software for SPARC running Solaris-2.

    power-ibm-aix
    ibm
    aix
	Configure this software for IBM rs6000 running AIX.

    alpha-dec-osf
    alpha
    osf3
	Configure this software for Dec Alpha running OSF/1.
	
If you don't give the host, it tries to make a guess by using `uname'.



2. Build 

	make

3. Install

	make install


There are two other targets in the Makefile that is good to have:

    clean:
	Removes all files that was created by running make.

    distclean:	
	As previous + the files created during configuration
	(distribution clean).
